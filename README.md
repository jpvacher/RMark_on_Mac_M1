# How to get Mark run on a Mac M1 - OS 11

*by Jean-Pierre Vacher and Matthieu Boileau - 2021.*

We wrote a procedure in unix for [RMark](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMark/index.html) users to get Mark run on Mac with M1 chips under OS 11 (Big Sur).

This should get RMark run on the latest R version (4.1). We also added a procedure to get Rjava run on a similar configuration in case this should also be an issue when using RMark.

You can see the html version of the page [here](https://jpvacher.github.io/run_Mark_Mac_M1.html).

Hope this helps!
